# Scenario Challenges

Present these as real-world situations. Ask the user what commands/shortcuts they'd use.
Use `ask_user` with choices for each step.

## Scenario 1: Hotfix Review Under Pressure
> A production bug fix is ready. You need to inspect the diff, run code review, and keep sensitive data hidden because you're on a livestream.

**Answer:** `/streamer-mode` → `/diff` → `/review @src/payment.ts`

## Scenario 2: Context Window Rescue
> Your session is huge and model quality is dropping. Keep continuity while shrinking noise.

**Answer:** `/context` → `/compact` → `/resume` (or restart with `--continue`)

## Scenario 3: Autonomous Refactor Sprint
> You want an agent to execute a refactor with minimal prompts, but only after reviewing a plan and setting permissions.

**Answer:** `Shift+Tab` (Plan mode) → validate plan → `/delegate` → optionally `/allow-all`

## Scenario 4: Enterprise Onboarding
> Set up custom agents, repo instructions, and MCP integration for a new team repository.

**Answer:** Add agent profiles to `.github/agents/`, verify `/instructions`, then `/mcp add`

## Scenario 5: Power Editing Session
> You're crafting a long prompt and need to edit quickly without losing context.

**Answer:** `Ctrl+X → Ctrl+E` (open in editor), `Ctrl+A` (jump to start), `Ctrl+K` (trim)

## Scenario 6: Agent Orchestration
> You're leading a complex project: understand code, run tests, refactor, then review.

**Answer:** `explore` agent (understand) → `task` agent (tests) → `general-purpose` (refactor) → `code-review` (verify)

## Scenario 7: New Project Setup
> You cloned a new repo and need to set up Copilot CLI for max productivity.

**Answer:** `/init` → `/model` → `/mcp add` (if needed) → `Shift+Tab` to Plan mode for first task

## Scenario 8: Production Safety
> Switching from boilerplate work to production deployment scripts.

**Answer:** `/reset-allowed-tools` → Plan mode → `/review` before every commit
